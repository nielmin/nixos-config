# My NixOS Setup

## Status

A work in progress.

Based off of [ryan4yin/i3-kickstarter](https://github.com/ryan4yin/nix-config/tree/i3-kickstarter) and his wonderful [NixOS & Flakes Book](https://nixos-and-flakes.thiscute.world/).

## Configuration Structure

- `home` and `users` are for home-manager.
-  Everything else is for NixOS.

## TODO
- [ ] Replicate dofiles neovim setup.
- [ ] Replicate dofiles emacs setup.
- [ ] Setup GNOME to my liking.
- [ ] Add another home-manager config for non-NixOS Linux.
